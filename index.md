### About
I am currently a **Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship** at [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am also a member of the group [Cambridge Image Analysis](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/). 


I received my Ph.D. from ENSICAEN and University of Caen Normandy advised by [Jalal Fadili](https://fadili.users.greyc.fr/) and [Gabriel Peyré](http://gpeyre.github.io/). I received my master degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the supervision of [Xiaoqun Zhang](http://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/). Prior to that I obtained my bachlor degree in Electrical & Information Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
